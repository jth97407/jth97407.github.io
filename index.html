			<p>Sharks are the most feared animal in the ocean. They are at the top of the food chain and are responsible for regulating the populations of the species that are below them in the food chain. All sharks have multiple rows of teeth, and new teeth grow as they lose their old ones. They are able to breathe through the 6 gill slits that are on either side of their upper body. Another cool thing about sharks is that they are dark on the top and lighter on the bottom. The reason this is so cool is because the darker side blends in with the water above them and the white underside of the shark blends with the lighter surface of the sea below.</p>

		 <p>Although sharks are feared by fish and humans alike, they are very necessary for a marine ecosystem. For example, if you were to take sharks out of a coral reef ecosystem the next largest predatory fish would grow in population. Grouper would be a prime example, and then the grouper would feed on the herbivores more heavily. With less herbivores in the environment, the algae expands and restricts the coral from growing and therefore damaging the reef ecosystem</p>
		 <p>There are more than 465 known species of sharks in the world, and everyone has their own favorites. Personally, my 3 favorite are listed below.:</p>
